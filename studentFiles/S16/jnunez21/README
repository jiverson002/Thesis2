Hello. My program should hopefully function correctly, with two small
quirks that don't affect the actual operation.

1) The "$: " prints strangely, sometimes appearing three times on a line,
   and often between every line.

2) If you try to send an empty message or broadcast, it works fine,
   but you'll need to press Enter two to four times depending on how much
   you type after the %M or %B. (E.g., "%M clientA" will require three Enter
   keystrokes, and "%M clientA " will require two Enter keystrokes).

I hope everything else performs as expected.

Thank you for your time.
