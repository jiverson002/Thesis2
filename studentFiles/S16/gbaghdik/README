-Issues:
	Did not put the header length in network order, 
	didn't have time to fix it. However, I am using
	memcpy, so I do not know if I still need to
	mess with the order?

	Sometimes when adding a new handle, the name will
	not get stored properly and you cannot send a direct
	message to the person. ---I hope this doesn't make me 
	fail the 3 person test!

	^^^edit: I believe I have fixed this issue

	The state machine and > 1000 byte message features are 
	untested, because I couldn't find a way make TCP send only
	one byte, and my terminal wouldn't let me input > 1000
	characters.

	I cannot get the "$: " prompt to display at the appropriate
	times.


	Thanks
