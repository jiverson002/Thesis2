For my client, I attempted to print the "$: " at the most proper timing. 
There are some weird prints of it due to that. I do not null terminate the
name strings unless I am unpacking them. They are sent without null terminators
but I add one when I unpack it so that I can use printf and strlen which depend
on a null character. 

I send the length in network order and therefore unpack it and convert from 
network to host. This is as the spec states. I also do this for the 32 bit name
count length variable. 

Do to some restraints with function calls having to be in order, I wasn't able
to function out my code as much as I'd like. One particular case is how recv
calls would only work if they were in the same function. 

Lastly, I have a fair number of #define statements that can be found in the 
networks.h file. I also use a few globals on both the server and client side
to achieve an easier tp follow and read structure. Hopefully those all help!
