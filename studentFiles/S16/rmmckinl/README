Known Issues:
      The only known issues is that when you do a %L command, two dollar sign propts will appear on one line. This is something that I decided to keep due to the way a flag = 11 and flag = 12 packets are processed. When a flag = 11 input is read, I process it as necessary, but then I return to the prompt $ because the spec wants there to be functionality between a flag = 11 and flag = 12 call. My server goes straight to sending the flag = 12 packet, but in case his server doesn't, I left it there.

File Description:

      tcp_client.c: Code pertaining to the client, specifically sending and recieving packets

      tcp_client_helper.c/.h: Helper code for the client, safe versions of common calls.

      tcp_server.c: Code pertaining to the server, most code is located here.

      tcp_server_helper.c/.h: Helper code for the server, mostly parsing.

      networks.c/.h: Code shared between the client and the server as well as the tcp calls from Smith.

      testing.c/.h: Code given from the starter .zip file.

      Makefile: Makes the server and cclient executables as well as a clean option to remove .o file.
