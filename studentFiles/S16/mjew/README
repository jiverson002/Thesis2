Notes: The only bug I am aware of is that occaisonally the program will output either a personal messege or a broadcast with strange characters at the end. Why? I don't know. I havn't been able to 
completly track it down. It's also inconsistent. Doesn't happen very often and I can't predict when it will happen. I believe it is a problem with the client side of the program but I don't why it's
happening, as I am null terminating all messeges.
