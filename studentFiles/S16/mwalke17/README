Known bugs
-A couple memory leaks
-Dynamic resizing isn't working properly - Causes server to seg fault
-Messages of over 1000 are not parsing correctly.

Edit: Tuesday Morning @ ~1045
-My original submission of my networks.h had a value inccorectly set such that
it will only allow 2 clients to connect. This was an accident during last minute
debugging. The #define INITIAL_LIST_SIZE 2 should be
 #define INITIAL_LIST_SIZE [number of clients you want]. The program is supposed
to dynamiclly allocated space for handles, but I do not have that feature
working correctly. Instead, the INITIAL_LIST_SIZE needs to be set the max number
of clients you will connect at that time. I am resubmitting my netowrks.h with a
INTIAL_LIST_SIZE OF 301 because the spec mentioned that 300 clients would be
connected.
