Known problems:
1) The largest message I was able to send (where it splits into multiple packets) was 1023 bytes. I found online that it was how many terminals buffered input, and I couldn't find a way to flush input. fflush() has undefined behavior for input file streams

2) Between flag = 11 and flag = 12, are we suppose to expect a large delay? My packets send without delay
3) Flag 11 tells the client the number of known handles. Why does the example for flag 12 have the number of known handles?!?!
