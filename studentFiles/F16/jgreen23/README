NOTE TO GRADERS: In this version, %L only works for the FIRST call. After that, it will cause the client to hang and break. I will hopefully have this working by the next hand in (if applicable).

 Also in this version, the message only can be 1000 chars long, I couldn't work out how to send across multiple packets. It does work for basic messages.
