Clone reports in clusters/post_cluster_*

In addition, potential clone-related bugs may be produced by running the scripts:
(Be careful about the file overwriting and the choice for programming language)

(0) search clone reports and find out suspicious ones for all config combinations: 
(Note that it may be slow if there are many clone groups)
    "/home/ooee/otherTools/Deckard/scripts/bugdetect/deckardd.sh"

Or, run "bugfilter" for each clone cluster file, but need to export DECKARD_DIR first:
    export DECKARD_DIR=/home/ooee/otherTools/Deckard
(1) search clone reports and find out suspicious ones: 
    "/home/ooee/otherTools/Deckard/scripts/bugdetect/bugfiltering" "clusters/post_<filename>" c > "clusters/bug_<filename>" 2> "times/bugfiltering_<filename>"
(2) transform the bug reports to html for easier investigation:
    "/home/ooee/otherTools/Deckard/src/main/out2html" "clusters/bug_<filename>" > "clusters/bug_<filename>.html"
